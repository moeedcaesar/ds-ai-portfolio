## üìä Dataset

- **Source:** IMDB Dataset of 50,000 movie reviews  
- **Balanced Classes:** 25,000 positive, 25,000 negative  
- **Columns:**
  - `review`: Raw movie review text  
  - `sentiment`: Target label (`positive` / `negative`)

## üßπ Data Preprocessing

1. **Tokenization:** Split reviews into words using NLTK.  
2. **Stopword Removal:** Removed common English stopwords.  
3. **Lowercasing & Cleaning:** Keep only alphabetic words, convert to lowercase.  
4. **Example of a cleaned review:**

- Applied preprocessing to all reviews and stored in a new column `clean_review`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Feature Extraction

- **Bag-of-Words (BoW)** model using `CountVectorizer` from scikit-learn.  
- Converts text into numerical feature vectors for model training.

## üîç Model

- **Algorithm:** Multinomial Naive Bayes (`MultinomialNB`)  
- **Train/Test Split:** 80% training, 20% testing  
- **Prediction Example:**

```python
clean_text = "This movie is my favourite movie"
count_vector = model.transform(pd.Series(clean_text))
model_nb.predict(count_vector)
# Output: ['positive']
