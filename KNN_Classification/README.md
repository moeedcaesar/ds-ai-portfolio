ðŸ©º Breast Cancer Classification

ðŸ“– Overview
This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant based on diagnostic features from cell nuclei.

ðŸ§  Skills Demonstrated

Data preprocessing and normalization using MinMaxScaler

Splitting data into training and testing sets

Model training using KNN

Performance evaluation with confusion matrix and classification report

Visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib

ðŸ§° Tools Used
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

ðŸš€ Results

Achieved 97.36% accuracy on test data

High precision and recall for both classes

ðŸ“Š Model Performance

Metric	Class 0 (Benign)	Class 1 (Malignant)
Precision	0.91	1.00
Recall	1.00	0.96
F1-Score	0.95	0.98
