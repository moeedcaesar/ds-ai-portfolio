## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Document Loading:**  
   - PDF document loaded and split into chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.  
   - Chunks converted to vector embeddings using Ollama embeddings.

2. **RAG Chain:**  
   - Uses **Chroma** vector store for retrieval.  
   - Combines user query, conversation history, and document context to generate answers.

3. **Chatbot Logic:**  
   - Checks if the query is history-related using regex patterns and capitalization heuristics.  
   - Provides factual responses or off-topic warnings.  
   - Clears memory when the user types `Exit`.

4. **Streamlit Frontend:**  
   - Displays chat messages in a user-friendly interface.  
   - Accepts user queries via a chat input.  
   - Dynamically updates the conversation.
